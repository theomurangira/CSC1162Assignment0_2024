You have started your job as 
a Software developer with annual salary 
of  RWF 9,600,000. You decide to
set up a saving account on which
you deposit 15% of you monthly salary and 
the saving account has a ( compound) 
interest rate of  6%  per year.
You want to request a bank loan to buy 
a RWF 80000000 house. You are not going 
to get the full amount to buy the house,
 rather you are going to request a loan 
 from your bank. However , the bank is 
 going to give you the loan only if you
 have at least 25% of the total price of
  the house in savings. Write a python 
  program that detrmines how many months 
  it will take to get the nedded 25% on 
  your saving account.
